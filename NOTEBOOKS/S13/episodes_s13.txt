=== Episode 1: Cake ===
For the first signature challenge, the bakers were required to bake 12 identical mini sandwich cakes in 2 hours. For the technical challenge, set by Prue, the bakers were tasked with making a six-layered [[red velvet cake]] in 2 hours, each layer sandwiched with cream cheese frosting and sprinkled with red crumbs. A 3D cake replica of a home that the bakers once lived in was set as the showstopper; the bakers were given 4 hours, the judges expecting the bake to be full of detail.

=== Episode 2: Biscuits ===
The signature bake was 18 Decorative [[macarons]] with a twist - they must be made to appear like something else. Two hours was given for the challenge. For the technical challenge, the bakers were given 1 hour and 45 minutes to bake 12 [[Garibaldi biscuits]] with feathered chocolate on top. A 3D biscuit mask to be completed in 4 hours was the showstopper challenge.

=== Episode 3: Bread ===
The bakers were set the task of making two sharing-size [[pizza]]s in 2 hours for the signature challenge. The technical challenge, set by Paul, was the baking of 12 [[pain aux raisins]], to be completed in 2 hours and 45 minutes. Finally, for their 4½-hour showstopper, the bakers were asked to create their own interpretation of a Swedish celebration 'cake', the [[Smörgåstårta]], topped with exquisite decorations.
