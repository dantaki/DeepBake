=== Episode 1: Cakes ===
For the first challenge, the bakers were given two hours to make a [[Madeira cake|Madeira Cake]], which was chosen as an "easy" challenge for the bakers. The cake should have a dome and a crack on top, though Mary stated the cake should not differ too far from the original. For the technical challenge, the bakers had one and three quarter hours to make Mary's recipe for a Frosted Walnut Cake, which should have three layers and a meringue coating, along with [[Caramelization|caramelised]] [[walnut]]s. A [[Black Forest gâteau|Black Forest Gâteau]] was set as the final challenge. In three and a half hours, the bakers were tasked with making a cake that should be extravagant, and should "impress" Mary and Paul.

For the signature challenge, the bakers were given two hours to bake 24 identical [[biscotti]] of any shape, flavour or size. In the technical challenge, they were required to make eight [[Palmier|arlettes]], which are high-end light delicate cinnamon-flavoured biscuits, in two and a half hours. For the show stopper, they were set the challenge of making 36 biscuits, to be presented in a biscuit box made of a different kind of biscuit mix. They were given four hours in this challenge.

=== Episode 3: Bread ===

In the first task, the bakers were given one and a half hour to make two [[quick bread]] to be made free-form (i.e. not in a tin). For the second task, Paul set the bakers the challenge of baking four identical crusty [[baguette]]s in two and a half hours.  For the final showstopper, the bakers needed to make a 3D bread sculpture in five hours, using three types of dough, and one of them should be filled.

=== Episode 4: Desserts ===
For the signature challenge, the bakers had 2 hours to make twelve [[crème brûlée]]s. The brief specified that the custard must be set and that the bakers weren't allowed to use a blowtorch to caramelize the top. For the technical challenge, the bakers had four hours to make a [[Spanische Windtorte]]. This dessert had two types of [[meringue]], Swiss and French, designed into a circular box and filled with cream and fruit. Three tiers of sweet cheesecakes were set as the showstopper. The structure must be self-standing, have unique flavors and be completed in four and one half hours.

=== Episode 5: Alternative Ingredients ===
This episode has a theme of using alternatives for ingredients usually used in baking. For the signature bake, the bakers were given the challenge of baking a cake, but without using sugar. They were given two and a half hour for the bake. For the technical bake, the challenge was to make twelve identical [[gluten-free]] [[pita bread]]s in two hours. In the showstopper, the bakers needed to make an [[Arctic roll|ice-cream roll]] using dairy-free ice-cream. They were given four and a half hours for the bake.

=== Episode 6: Pastry ===
For this week's signature challenge, the bakers had to make a [[Frangipane]] tart in two hours, the brief being that it must be open-topped and use [[shortcrust pastry]]. In the technical, the bakers had to make 12 [[Flaouna|Flauones]], a cheese filled pastry made in Cyprus. They had two hours. [[Vol-au-vent]]s were set as the Showstopper - the bakers had to make two types, all using their own [[puff pastry]] - in three hours and forty five minutes.

=== Episode 7: Victorian ===
For the first challenge, the bakers had three hours to make a Raised Game Pie. The pie must have thin [[Hot water crust pastry]], and must be very ornate, as most game pies from the era were. For the technical challenge, a Tennis fruit Cake was set for the bakers. The bakers were given three hours to make a [[fruit cake]], along with [[royal icing]] and [[sugar paste]], with much [[gelatine]] being used. A [[Charlotte Russe]] was set as the Showstopper. To be done in five and a half hours, the bake usually has [[Ladyfinger (biscuit)|ladyfingers]] around jelly and a sponge - with flavour and decoration being key.

=== Episode 8: Pâtisserie ===
In the first quarter-final challenge, the bakers had to make twenty-four cream horns in three and a half hours. They were asked to make twenty four [[cream horn]]s - twelve of each flavour, using either puff, ruff puff or flaky pastry. Mary's recipe for nine Mochatines was set as the technical challenge. These were small, delicate [[Genoise|genoise sponges]], filled with a coffee [[buttercream]] meant to be attractive, as if "in a [[pâtisserie]] window". They would only have two hours. [[Religieuse]] à l'ancienne were set as the Showstopper challenge. These would be large éclairs, stood upright with no dowelling, and decorated with buttercream. They were given four hours, though the towers were left to stand for two hours afterwards, as traditional religieuse would have been left for such time. As a result, some of the towers began to collapse or lean upon being presented to Mary and Paul.

=== Episode 9: Chocolate (Semi-Final) ===
For the first challenge, the bakers had two and a half hours to make a chocolate tart. The tart had to be ornate, intricate, and full of flavour. For the technical, the bakers faced a staggered start, and were each given one hour and fifteen minutes to make a chocolate [[soufflé]] - with Flora starting first, followed by Ian, Nadiya, then Tamal. A chocolate centrepiece was set as the showstopper. In four hours, the bakers had to create an ornate centrepiece using white chocolate in some form and including a biscuit element, the centrepiece having to be free-standing and attractive. Flora's elimination meant that she was the first baker to have finished first in the technical challenge and be eliminated the same week.

=== Episode 10: Final ===
In the final signature challenge, the bakers had to make 16 [[iced bun]]s, of which there must be two kinds, in three hours. In the technical, the judges decided to use one of [[Paul Hollywood|Paul]]'s recipes; the bakers had to bake raspberry-flavoured [[mille-feuille]] in two hours. The recipe involved pastry - something all of the bakers had struggled with. In the final Showstopper, the bakers were given four hours to make classic British cakes in a multi-layered presentation.
