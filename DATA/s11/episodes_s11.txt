=== Episode 1: Cake ===	
For the signature challenge, the bakers created an intricate [[Battenberg cake]]. For the technical challenge set by Paul, the bakers baked six miniature pineapple [[Upside-Down Cake|upside-down cakes]]. At the end of the challenge, Sura, who saw a fly and was trying to brush it away, accidentally hit Dave's tray of six miniature cakes as he was setting them down, knocking four to the floor. Prue and Paul judged the better looking of the remaining two, assuming the rest were the same. For the showstopper challenge, the bakers created a 3-D cake [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] depicting their personal celebrity hero.
