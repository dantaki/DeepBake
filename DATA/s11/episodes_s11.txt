=== Episode 1: Cake ===	
For the signature challenge, the bakers created an intricate [[Battenberg cake]]. For the technical challenge set by Paul, the bakers baked six miniature pineapple [[Upside-Down Cake|upside-down cakes]]. At the end of the challenge, Sura, who saw a fly and was trying to brush it away, accidentally hit Dave's tray of six miniature cakes as he was setting them down, knocking four to the floor. Prue and Paul judged the better looking of the remaining two, assuming the rest were the same. For the showstopper challenge, the bakers created a 3-D cake [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] depicting their personal celebrity hero.

The broadcast of Episode 1 began at 8:15pm instead of 8:00pm, following Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]]'s address to the nation on the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 pandemic]].  The episode began with a parody of the Johnson address by new presenter Matt Lucas.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/23/entertainment/matt-lucas-boris-johnson-great-british-bake-off-intl-scli-gbr/index.html |title='Great British Bake Off': Matt Lucas revives his Boris Johnson, urging viewers to 'Save Loaves' during 'Great British Bake Off' debut|work=CNN |date=23 September 2020 |first=Toyin |last=Owoseje }}</ref>
