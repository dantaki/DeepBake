In this challenge, Deborah accidentally used Howard's custard. As a result, Howard used Deborah's custard in his trifle. This switch was revealed to Paul and Mary, who based their judgement on the custards each baker had made, not the custards that ended up in their own dessert. The incident was dubbed Custardgate by the Press.

=== Episode 4: Pies and Tarts ===
For the signature challenge the bakers are asked to bake a double-crusted fruit pie with a filling of their choice. For their fourth technical challenge, the bakers were required to bake a tart that has almost a 700-year history; the egg custard tart.
