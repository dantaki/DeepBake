=== Episode 1: Cakes ===
For the first challenge, the bakers were instructed to make a cake using fresh fruit, with no dried fruit permitted, in two hours. For the technical challenge, the bakers were instructed to make 12 chocolate [[Swiss roll|mini rolls]] using Prue's recipe which contains [[peppermint]] cream, in two hours. The showstopper challenge required the bakers to make an illusion cake: a cake that appears to be some other object. They had four hours to complete the task.

=== Episode 2: Biscuits ===
For the Signature Challenge, the bakers were instructed to make 24 [[sandwich cookie|sandwich biscuits]] in 2 hours and 15 minutes. For the technical challenge, the bakers faced a very difficult challenge of making [[fortune cookie]]s of two types of flavours – one is almond and one is orange, in 2 hours. For the final showstopper challenge, the bakers were required to make a biscuit [[board game]] that should be at least 40&nbsp;cm long in diameter and has at least 8 elements in 3 ½ hours.<ref>{{citeweb|url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2017/sep/05/the-great-british-bake-off-2017-episode-two-live|title= The Great British Bake Off 2017, episode two – as it happened|date=5 September 2017|work=Guardian|accessdate=6 September 2017}}</ref>

===Episode 4: Caramel===
For the first signature challenge, the bakers were required to produce 18 identical [[caramel shortbread|millionaire shortbread]] bars in 2 hours and 15 minutes. The technical challenge was set by Prue where the bakers were tasked to make [[stroopwafel]]s in 1 hour and 45 minutes. Only one test waffle was allowed, and the challenge proved to be a very difficult one for the bakers with none of them producing an adequate [[caramel]]. For the final showstopper challenge, the bakers were required to make a caramel cake consisting of at least three layers of [[sponge cake|sponge]] in 3 ½ hours. They were required to incorporate [[spun sugar]] into their decorations.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2017/sep/19/the-great-british-bake-off-2017-episode-four-live|title=The Great British Bake Off 2017, episode four – as it happened|date=19 September 2017|work=Guardian|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref>

=== Episode 5: Puddings ===
For the signature challenge, the eight remaining bakers were required to bake a steamed [[school pudding]] with an accompaniment such as a [[compote]] or a [[custard]] in 3 hours. The technical challenge was set by Paul, which was 6 [[Molten chocolate cake|molten chocolate]] puddings with a [[peanut butter]] filling in 1 hour. Each baker was called one at a time so their puddings could be ready at different times for Paul and Prue to judge (starting with Julia, followed by Sophie, Liam, Steven, Yan, Kate, James and finally Stacey). For the showstopper challenge, the bakers were asked to bake an ornamental [[trifle]] [[terrine (food)|terrine]] with three elements – a baked element, a set [[custard]] or [[mousse]], and a [[Gelatin dessert|jelly]], in 4 ½ hours .<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2017/sep/26/the-great-british-bake-off-2017-episode-five-live|title=The Great British Bake Off 2017, episode five – as it happened|date=26 September 2017|work=Guardian|accessdate=29 September 2017}}</ref>

=== Episode 6: Pastry ===
In the signature challenge, the bakers were required to produce four decorative savoury pies using [[shortcrust pastry]] with different designs on the pies that share a common theme in 2½ hours. For the technical challenge, set by Paul, the bakers were tasked to produce 12 [[Pastel de nata|pastéis de nata]] using [[flaky pastry|rough puff]] pastry in 2 hours. For the final showstopper challenge, the bakers were required to produce a family-sized hand-raised pie with a savoury filling using [[hot water crust pastry]], topped with glazed fruits in 4 hours.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2017/oct/03/the-great-british-bake-off-2017-episode-six-live |title=The Great British Bake Off 2017, episode six – as it happened|date=3 October 2017|work=Guardian|accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>

=== Episode 7: Italian ===
For the first ever Italian week in Bake Off, the bakers were given {{frac|2|1|2}} hours to make the required 18 Sicilian [[cannoli]] with three different types of fillings. This week's Italian technical challenge was set by Prue, where the bakers were tasked to make the well-known, yet tricky, [[pizza margherita]] with a thin crispy base in {{frac|1|1|2}} hours. For the showstopper challenge, the bakers were required to make a very technically challenging and fiddly Italian bake: 24 [[Sfogliatella|sfogliatelle]] with two types of fillings in {{frac|4|1|2}} hours.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2017/oct/10/the-great-british-bake-off-2017-episode-seven-live |title=The Great British Bake Off 2017, episode seven – as it happened|date=10 October 2017|work=Guardian|accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>

=== Episode 8: Forgotten bakes ===
The bakers were required to make four [[Bedfordshire clanger]]s within 2 hours in the signature challenge. They must each contain a savoury filling at one end and a sweet filling at the other, and be made from [[suet]] crust pastry. In the technical challenge, set by Paul, the bakers were tasked to make a traditional [[Cumberland]] rum nicky: a large tart consisting of a sweet [[shortcrust]] pastry and a [[rum]]-soaked fruity filling covered with a [[lattice (pastry)|lattice]] top, and served with a smooth [[Hard sauce|rum butter]]. For the historic showstopper, the bakers were required to make a Victorian Savoy cake.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2017/oct/17/the-great-british-bake-off-2017-episode-eight-live |title=The Great British Bake Off 2017, episode eight – as it happened|date=17 October 2017|work=Guardian|accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>

=== Episode 9: Pâtisserie (semi-final) ===
For the semifinal signature bakes, the bakers were asked to make 24 [[Choux pastry|choux]] buns, in which 12 must have a crunchy [[craquelin]] on top and the other 12 must be covered with icing. The penultimate technical challenge was set by Prue, where the bakers were tasked with a very difficult job of making 9 [[Misérable cake|Les Misérables slices]]. For the showstopper challenge before the final, the bakers were asked to make a [[meringue]] centrepiece, containing at least two different types of meringue and a dessert element, in 4 hours and 45 minutes.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2017/oct/24/great-british-bake-off-2017-semi-final-follow-it-live |title=The Great British Bake Off 2017 semi-final – as it happened|date=24 October 2017|work=Guardian|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref>

=== Episode 10: Final ===
For the signature challenge in the final, the last three bakers were tasked to make a batch of 12 small loaves. There must be three different types of loaves: four need to be intricately shaped (e.g. plaited), four need to be flavoured, and four need to be made from an alternative grain such as [[spelt]] or [[buckwheat]]. Prue set the final technical challenge and asked the bakers to make 10 [[ginger biscuit]]s, half of them to be oval and half of them to be square.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41822794 |title= The Great British Bake Off 2017: How the final unfolded|date=31 October 2017|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>	
They all need to have a great snap and be intricately iced with two complicated patterns. For the ultimate showstopper challenge, the bakers were tasked to make one large [[entremet]]. The entremet must have a minimum of five elements, one of which must be a [[sponge cake|sponge]], and covered with a [[Glaze (cooking technique)|glaze]] or [[ganache]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2017/oct/31/great-british-bake-off-2017-final-watch-live |title=The Great British Bake Off 2017 final – as it happened|date=31 October 2017|work=Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>
