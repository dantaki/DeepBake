=== Episode 1: Biscuits ===
Breaking with tradition, this year the series kicked off with Biscuits week. For the first challenge of the series, the bakers were tasked to bake 24 regional biscuits that needed to be all identical, and said something about them and a place in the British Isles. For the first technical challenge of this series, they are tasked to make one of Paul's childhood favourites - [[Wagon Wheels]]. Finally, for the showstopper, the bakers had to create a spectacular 3D biscuit self-portrait that needed to be constructed with layers of biscuits and judged while placed upright on an easel stand.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2018/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-2018-episode-one-live |title =The Great British Bake Off 2018: episode one - as it happened|date=28 August 2018|work=Guardian|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref>

=== Episode 2: Cakes ===
For their signature bakes, the bakers were required to create a traybake sliced into 16 identical pieces. The technical challenge was set by Prue, which featured a cake with an unusual ingredient: Le gâteau vert, one of French painter [[Claude Monet]]'s favourite birthday treats. The cake featured a [[pistachio]] [[genoise]] sponge sandwiched by a pistachio Crème au Beurre and covered by a green fondant coloured by [[spinach]]. For the showstopper, the bakers were required to create a technically demanding chocolate collar cake, featuring at least two tiers.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2018/sep/04/the-great-british-bake-off-2018-episode-two-live |title =The Great British Bake Off 2018: episode two - as it happened|date=4 September 2018|work=Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref>

=== Episode 3: Bread ===
For their signature bakes, the bakers were required to create a British classic: 12 [[Chelsea bun]]s. For their technical challenge, using Paul's recipe, the bakers were tasked to make a batch of 8 non-yeasted garlic [[naan bread]]s, brushed with garlic ghee and topped with coriander, in only one hour. Finally, for their 5-hour showstopper, the bakers were tasked to create a three-tiered [[Korovai]], which will be elaborately decorated for their chosen celebratory occasion. Most of the bakers had chosen the traditional wedding theme.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2018/sep/11/the-great-british-bake-off-2018-episode-three-live |title =The Great British Bake Off 2018: episode three - as it happened|date=11 September 2018|work=Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref>

=== Episode 4: Desserts ===
At the start of this episode, it was announced that Terry was not able to compete this week due to illness. But, with the agreement of all, he would be allowed to come back to the competition the following week. For their signature bakes, the bakers were required to create a [[meringue]] [[roulade]]. For their technical challenge, using Prue's recipe, the bakers were tasked to produce a raspberry [[blancmange]] served with 12 [[Cat tongue|Langues de Chat]] biscuits. For their showstoppers, the bakers were tasked to create a spectacular melting chocolate ball dessert: a chocolate sphere which would be melted away with a hot sauce, revealing the dessert hidden inside. After the three challenges, Briony and Karen were the two bakers left at the bottom. However, nobody was eliminated this week, as the judges deemed it would be unfair to send anyone home with Terry's absence. However, this meant two bakers would be eliminated the following week.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2018/sep/18/the-great-british-bake-off-2018-episode-four-live |title =The Great British Bake Off 2018: episode four - as it happened|date=18 September 2018|work=Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref>

=== Episode 5: Spice ===
For the signature challenge, the bakers were tasked to bake a [[ginger]] cake. For the technical challenge, using Paul's recipe, the bakers must create a batch of 12 [[Ma'amoul]], an ancient pastry from the Middle East that none of the bakers had heard of. In the batch, 6 of the ma'amoul must be filled with [[walnuts]] and shaped with a mould, and the other 6 must be filled with a [[Date (fruit)|date]] paste and decorated by pinching the dough with ma'amoul tongs. For their showstoppers, the bakers were tasked to create a beautiful, gravity-defying spiced biscuit [[chandelier]]. Prue was unwell during the showstoppers round, and as a result, Paul was left as the solo judge.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2018/sep/25/great-british-bake-off-2018-episode-five-live |title =The Great British Bake Off 2018: episode five - as it happened|date=26 September 2018|work=Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref>

=== Episode 6: Pastry ===
For the signature challenge, the bakers were tasked to make 12 [[samosas]], in which 6 must be savoury and the other 6 must be sweet. The samosas must also be served with a dip to complement them. The technical challenge was set by Prue, and the bakers were required to make 6 [[Puits d'amour]], meaning "well of love". For the showstopper challenge, the bakers were tasked to create a shaped banquet pie that would be beautifully decorated enough to act as a centrepiece at a Tudor's banquet.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2018/oct/02/the-great-british-bake-off-2018-episode-six-live |title =The Great British Bake Off 2018: episode six - as it happened|date=2 October 2018|work=Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref>

=== Episode 7: Vegan ===
The remaining six bakers were required in the signature challenge to make eight savoury [[vegan]] [[tartlets]] of two different fillings using [[shortcrust]] pastry that contained no butter or eggs. For the technical challenge, using Prue's recipe, the bakers were tasked to make a vegan tropical fruit [[Pavlova (food)|pavlova]] using [[aquafaba]] in place of egg whites to create the [[meringue]]. For the showstopper, the bakers were tasked to create a beautiful vegan celebratory cake.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2018/oct/09/the-great-british-bake-off-2018-episode-seven-live |title =The Great British Bake Off 2018: episode seven - as it happened|date=9 October 2018|work=Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref>

=== Episode 8: Danish ===
In the quarterfinal signature challenge, the final five bakers were tasked to make a [[rye bread]] and make two types of ''[[Smørrebrød]]'' using it. For the technical challenge, the bakers were instructed to make 14 ''[[Æbleskiver]]'' containing a cinnamon and apple filling, and served with a strawberry jam dipping sauce. For the showstopper challenge, the bakers were required to make a [[kagemand]] or a kagekone, a traditional Danish birthday cake made from [[Danish pastry]] that resemble a boy or a girl. The bakers' kagemand/kagekone must be based on someone the bakers recognised and they must use at least three different [[confectionery]] making skills within it.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2018/oct/16/the-great-british-bake-off-2018-episode-eight-live |title =The Great British Bake Off 2018: episode eight - as it happened|date=16 October 2018|work=Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref>

=== Episode 9: Pâtisserie (semi-final) ===
In the [[Pâtisserie]] semifinal signature challenge, the bakers were tasked to make 24 dipped [[Madeleine (cake)|Madeleines]] in two designs and flavours, in 90 minutes. For the technical challenge, the bakers tackled Prue's complex recipe for Torta Setteveli, a seven-layered cake containing two light chocolate [[genoise]] sponges, hazelnut [[Bavarian cream|bavarois]], crunchy [[Praline#European_nut_pralines|praline]] base and a chocolate [[mousse]], topped with a chocolate mirror glaze, to be completed in  three 1/2 hours. For the penultimate showstopper challenge, the bakers created a Parisian [[pâtisserie]] window containing 36 pâtisserie in three types: [[choux pastry]], [[shortcrust pastry|pate sucree]] and [[puff pastry]] [[mille-feuille]], in five hours.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2018/oct/23/great-british-bake-off-2018-semi-final-live |title =The Great British Bake Off 2018: semi-final - as it happened|date=23 October 2018|work=Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref>

=== Episode 10: Final ===
For the final signature challenge, the last three bakers were tasked to make 12 iced [[doughnuts]] of two types, in which one type must be filled doughnuts and the other must be ring doughnuts. For the technical challenge, there was a first in Bake Off where the bakers were asked to carry out the challenge outside the tent. Using Paul's recipe, the bakers must create 6 [[pita]] breads served with three different dips: [[baba ghanoush]], smoked garlic [[salsa verde]] and burnt pepper salsa, using the open campfire set up outside. For the final showstopper, the bakers must create an incredible [[landscape]] dessert with at least three different elements within it. During the showstopper, one of Rahul's storage glass jar exploded under the intense heat, which resulted in shards of broken glass shattered all over his bench and potentially contaminated his bakes. This required cleaning up from the production team. As a result, he was given an extra 15 minutes for the challenge.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2018/oct/30/the-great-british-bake-off-2018-final-find-out-who-takes-the-crown |title =The Great British Bake Off 2018: final - as it happened|date=30 October 2018|work=Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref>
