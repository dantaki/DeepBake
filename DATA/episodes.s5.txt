=== Episode 2: Biscuits ===
In this episode, the bakers were challenged with creating biscuits. Firstly, in the signature, they had two hours to bake 36 savoury biscuits. In the technical challenge, they had one and a quarter hours with Mary Berry's recipe for 18 [[florentine biscuit|florentines]], which the bakers found difficult. In the final challenge, the bakers had four hours to make some kind of 3D biscuit scene.

=== Episode 3: Bread ===
In bread week, the bakers firstly had to make twelve [[rye bread]] [[Bread roll|rolls]] in three and a half hours. In the technical challenge, they were given three hours to make four [[ciabatta]] loaves using Paul's recipe, with the advice from Paul that they should be patient. In the showstopper, the bakers were required to make a bread centrepiece in four hours. The centrepiece should be a filled-loaf that is spectacular and tasty, and would be judged on its appearance, design and crust, and should be well-baked on the inside.<small><nowiki/></small>

=== Episode 4: Desserts ===
For the signature bake, the judges gave the bakers two hours to make eight self-saucing puddings, meaning the sauce should come from the bake itself. The bakers may choose to make either a [[Molten chocolate cake|fondant]] or a sponge which creates its own sauce at the bottom. In the technical, they had to bake Mary's own [[tiramisu]] cake recipe in two and a half hours. In the showstopper, they had four and a half hours to make [[baked Alaska]]s.

Many of the bakers struggled to make baked Alaskas, as it was the hottest day of the year so far, and two of five refrigerators were broken, resulting in a struggle among the contestants for enough freezer space.<ref name="guardian-ian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-ian-watters-speaks-diana-beard|title=Great British Bake Off: Iain Watters speaks out as Diana Beard quits|last=Ellis-Petersen|first=Hannah|date=August 28, 2014|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=May 12, 2017}}</ref> During the bake, Diana took Iain's ice cream and sponge cake assembly out of the freezer to make room for hers, mistakenly leaving it out on a counter in the hot tent. When Iain found it, the ice cream had melted and, frustrated, he threw the sponge cake and melted ice cream in the dustbin. (It was later stated by producers that the dessert was only out for one minute.) Paul and Mary chastised him for this decision, explaining that they would rather have judged sample pieces of each baked Alaska component or even a melted final product than nothing at all, and his decision to present Paul and Mary with nothing to judge contributed to his elimination. Viewers of the show objected on Twitter, attacking Diana.<ref name="guardian-ian" /> Iain spoke out against these online attacks,<ref name="guardian-ian" /> and Diana claimed that the editing had distorted the truth, "stitching [her] up". She subsequently withdrew from the show after suffering an injury a fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2736048/Bake-Off-meltdown-Cook-storms-crying-foul-TV-rival-sabotages-ice-cream-pudding.html|title=Great British Bake Off grandmother QUITS show in tears claiming BBC 'stitched her up' over binned pudding scandal, as hundreds complain|date=August 27, 2014|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=May 12, 2017}}</ref>

=== Episode 5: Pies and Tarts ===
For signature challenge, the bakers were set the task of a family-sized [[custard tart]] in two and half hour. The tart should have a crispy base and silky custard. The technical challenge is set using one of Paul's recipes, and the bakers were required to make six mini pear pies, which are poached pears surrounded by rough [[puff pastry]], to be completed in two hours. In the showstopper, the bakers were tasked with making tiered pies in four and half hours. The pies needed to be able to support themselves, and should have at least three tiers and share a common theme.

Before the round began, it was announced that Diana had to withdraw from the competition due to the Controversy last week and health reasons &ndash; she had lost her sense of taste and smell in a fall.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/diana-beard-quit-bake-off-smell-taste|title=Diana Beard: I quit Bake Off after losing sense of taste and smell|last=Ellis-Petersen|first=Hannah|date=28 August 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> 

=== Episode 6: European Cakes ===
For the signature bake, the challenge was to bake a cake inspired by a European cake, but the cake must be [[leavened]] with yeast. The bakers were given three hours for the challenge. The technical challenge was set using one of Mary's recipes for a Swedish [[Princess cake]] (''Prinsesstårta''). The recipe is the most complicated yet, requiring 26 separate ingredients with 14 stages, and to be completed in two and a quarter hours. For the showstopper challenge, the bakers were required to make a contemporary version of the Hungarian [[Dobos torte|Dobos Torte]] in five hours. The cake should have at least two tiers, with particular emphasis on caramel sugar work on the cake.

No one was eliminated this week as the judges could not agree on the worst-performing baker, stating it was between Richard and Kate. As Diana left the show before the previous week's contest due to illness, it was possible not to eliminate anyone.

=== Episode 7: Pastry ===

In their first task, the bakers were set the challenge of making twelve savoury pastry parcels, to be completed in an hour and three quarters. The parcels can be of any type of pastries, but should be uniform in size, well-filled, perfectly cooked and well-sealed to prevent leaks. The technical bake was one that for the first time none of the bakers had heard of, the [[Breton people|Breton]] pastry [[kouign-amann]], using one of Paul's recipes. The bakers should make twelve identical kouign-amanns in three and a half hours. For the final challenge, the bakers were required to make 24 [[Éclair]]s of two different flavours (12 of each) in four hours. The éclairs should be made of [[choux pastry]] and éclair-shaped, otherwise the bakers were free to do as they wished to produce a showstopper.

=== Episode 8: Advanced Dough ===
For the signature bake, they were given the challenge of making sweet fruit loaves that must be free form. They had two and a half hours for the bake which is challenging as the bakers were required to use enriched dough which takes longer to [[Proofing (baking technique)|proof]]. In the technical, they had two and a half hours to make a [[povitica]], which Chetna had made for her signature loaf. This technical challenge was particularly hard for most of the bakers, many of whose loafs were raw inside and deemed unsafe to eat. [[Doughnuts]] were set as the challenge in the final task, and the bakers were required to make eighteen each of two different sorts, to be completed in four hours.

For the signature challenge, the bakers had to make [[baklava]], with a time limit of three and a half hours to complete the challenge. There had to be two different types of baklava, and twenty-four portions in total. For the technical challenge, the bakers had to make a [[Baumkuchen#Schichttorte|schichttorte]], and had two hours to complete it. There had to be twenty layers in their schichttorte, and was one of Paul's recipes. For the showstopper challenge, the bakers had to make [[entremets]], very small and fine cakes put in a window of a French [[pâtisserie]]. They had to make two different types of entremets, twelve of each, and had five hours to complete the challenge.

=== Episode 10: Final ===
In the final signature challenge, the bakers had to make [[Viennoiserie]] in three and a half hours. They had to make two different types of the pastry. In the technical, the judges decided to bring things "back to basics" by asking the bakers to bake 12 [[Victoria Sandwich]]es, [[Tarte au Citron|Tartes au citron]] and [[Scone]]s. The challenge, however, was that they had only two hours to make this and only three instructions. The final Showstopper was a [[Pièce montée|Pièce Montée]]. The bakers were given five hours to make this, and the judges said it must be in some self-standing structure.
