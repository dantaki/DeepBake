=== Episode 1: Cakes ===
The contestants were required to make an [[upside-down cake|Upside-Down Cake]] for their signature bake. The bakers were given two hours to make a sponge topped with fruits of their choice. For the technical bake, Paul set the bakers the challenge of making four [[rum baba|Rum Baba]]s with cream in the middle and sliced fruits on top, to be completed in three hours. For the showstopper, the bakers were given the task of making a cake in five hours, and the cake baked should reveal a hidden design when cut.

=== Episode 2: Bread ===
For the signature bake, the bakers were required to make twelve [[Flatbreads]]; six with yeast, six without. They were given two and a half hours to complete the task. For the technical challenge, they had to make an eight-strand plaited loaf in two hours using a recipe from Paul. For the showstopper bake, the bakers were given four hours to make 24 [[bagel]]s: 12 sweet, and 12 savoury.

=== Episode 3: Tarts ===
The classic [[tarte tatin|Tarte Tatin]] was set as the signature challenge. The Tarte Tatin could be sweet or savoury, and had to be finished in two and half hours. Baking a [[Treacle tart|Treacle Tart]] was set as the technical challenge by Mary, with the requirement that the pastry lattice on top be woven. The bakers were given two hours for the challenge. For the showstopper, the bakers were required to make a large designer Fruit Tart, fit for a window display, in less than three hours.

=== Episode 4: Desserts ===
The bakers were given three hours to make a [[torte|Torte Cake]] (made without conventional wheat flour) as the signature bake. The torte should be more than 20&nbsp;cm in diameter. Mary set [[crème caramel|Crème Caramel]] as the technical challenge, to be finished two and three-quarter hours. A four-layered [[meringue]] dessert was the showstopper challenge.

In this episode, Mel wasn't present but will be present in the next episode.

=== Episode 5: Pies ===
The signature bake was [[Beef Wellington|Wellington]], which Paul specified should be at least 8 inches long and completely covered with pastry. The bakers were given three hours for the challenge. The technical challenge was to make a Hand-Raised Pie in two and a quarter hours. This was to be made with [[Hot water crust pastry|hot water crust]] and molded using a dolly. The pie was left to set overnight and judged the next day. For the showstopper challenge, the bakers were required to bake a family-sized sweet American-style pie in three and a half hours.

During the broadcast, Ryan's pie was identified as a [[key lime pie]]. However, it was made with ordinary limes rather than [[key lime]]s, and thus was not a key lime pie. Moreover, the pies described as American-style were actually tarts. American pies are baked in a smooth, slant sides pie pan, not the fluted tart pans that were used.

=== Episode 6: Puddings ===
The bakers were challenged to make, in two hours, two different flavoured sponge puddings with different accompaniments, six of each. Mary set the [[Queen of Puddings]] as the technical challenge. For the showstopper, the bakers were required to make in three and a half hours one large strudel, either with sweet or savoury fillings.

John cut a deep wound on his finger on the blade of the food processor, had to leave the show to receive medical attention, and therefore did not complete his challenge. As a result, the judges thought that it would be unfair to eliminate any baker this week.

=== Episode 7: Sweet dough ===
For the signature bake, the bakers were set to bake 24 [[buns]] made from an enriched dough with yeast in three hours. The buns should be all of the same size and evenly baked. For the technical bake, the bakers were challenged to make ten [[jam doughnut|Jam Doughnut]]s, using Paul's recipe, in two and a half hours. The jam doughnuts should be consistent in size, shape, jam distribution, and colour. During this challenge, Sue narrates about wartime donuts for American soldiers at army bases in Britain. For the showstopper, the bakers each made a Celebratory enriched-dough Loaf. This challenge started straight after the technical bake, so that the dough could be [[Proofing (baking technique)|proofed]] overnight if necessary.

Two bakers were eliminated this week as there was no elimination the previous week.

=== Episode 8: Biscuits (Quarterfinal) ===
The bakers are given two hours to make 48 [[Cracker (food)|cracker]]s or [[crisp bread]] for their signature bake. They should be thin, evenly baked and crack when snapped in two. For the technical challenge, the bakers were asked to make six [[Chocolate-coated marshmallow treats#Teacake|Chocolate Teacakes]] in two hours using Paul's recipe, a task made more difficult because the high temperature that day would not allow the chocolate to cool. For the showstopper bake, the bakers were challenged to make a [[Gingerbread]] structure, which should not be a gingerbread house, in four hours.

=== Episode 9: Pâtisserie (Semi-Final) ===
For the first [[pâtisserie]] test, the bakers were required to make three type of [[petits fours|Petits Fours]], twelve of each. These should be small (each a single mouthful), exquisite and perfect. Mary set the bakers to make a Fraisier cake for the technical challenge. [[Choux pastry|Choux Pastry]] [[Gateau]] was set as the showstopper.

=== Episode 10: Final ===
The finalists were set the task of making savoury [[Pithivier]] in two and a half hours. Paul and Mary's technical challenge required 25 [[French Fancies|Fondant Fancies]]. For the final showstopper, the finalists were required to make in four hours a [[chiffon cake]] based on the theme of their personal highlights of 2012. All the bakes were served at a special summer fête held on the ground of [[Harptree Court]].

===Extras and special episodes===
Four additional episodes were broadcast after the final. Episode 11 was a masterclass by Paul and Mary where they demonstrated how to make the technical challenges they set - treacle tarts, rum babas, creme caramels, the hand-raised pie, and the eight-strand plaited loaf. Episode 12 revisited the bakers from [[The Great British Bake Off (series 2)|series 2]] to catch up on what these contestants had been doing after the show ended. Another masterclass was shown in episode 13 where Paul and Mary showed how to make queen of puddings, jam doughnuts, tempered chocolate teacakes, fraisier cakes and fondant fancies. In episode 14, Paul and Mary showed which signature bakes they would have chosen if they were in the bakers' shoes (including sponge puddings, flat breads and sweet buns). A further episode of Masterclass was shown before Easter.
