							<h2>A little bit on the predictions</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								For each baker, DeepBake calculates probabilities for the following brackets.
								
								<ul class="feature-icons">
									<li class="icon solid fa-trophy"> 1. GBBO Winner</li>
									<li class="icon solid fa-medal"> 2. GBBO Finalist</li>
									<li class="icon solid fa-award"> 3. Semi-Finalist or Quarter-Finalist</li>
									<li class="icon solid fa-cookie"> 4. Eliminated in Weeks 7 through 5</li>
									<li class="icon solid fa-cookie-bite"> 5. Eliminated in Weeks 4 through 1</li>
								</ul>
								The sum of the brackets is 100% for an individual baker. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Predictions for who will leave the tent are made with respect to remaining bakers. The baker predicted to leave will have the highest probability with respect to the week of competition. For example, week 6 DeepBake  gives Bob 75% and Jill 64% in bracket 4. (Week 7-5). Since Bob was eliminated on week 5, Jill is the baker that DeepBake predicts to leave, she has the maximum probability for that bracket of the remaining bakers.
							</p>

							<p>
								DeepBake uses data collected from the technical challenges and from the judges when they discuss who has done well and who has done poorly. So when the Star-Baker is announced, we pause the telly and input the new data to make a prediction on who might leave the tent. This is how predictions are made for each week. For more details, check out the <a href="https://github.com/dantaki/DeepBake#what-is-this">GitHub</a> repository.
							</p>

							<p>
								In my experience, DeepBake seems to get better at predicting who will win the competition after week 4. Check out previous predictions for<a href="s10.html"> season 10</a>. Note that for bracket 1. the GBBO Winner, they will also qualify for bracket 2., GBBO Finalist.

							<h2>Week 5</h2>
							<h3>Pastry</h3>
						</header>
						<div class="content">

							<p>
								This week many bakers have done well, Laura deemed herself queen of Pastry Week with consistently good bakes. Sadly, Linda has struggled this week placing last in the technical. Well what else can you say, the data don't lie. DeepBake predicted Linda would leave the tent, since she had the highest probability of remaining bakers to be eliminated during Weeks 5 through 7. Another win for DeepBake, but sad for the quirky baker who made an Amsterdam <i>High</i> Tea themed bake.

								As for the winners, DeepBake is putting a lot of weight on Hermine to take the crown, even giving her more than 60% chance of being a Finalist. Dave is also favored to compete in the Final along with Mark L. 
							</p>
							<p>
								As for who might leave next week, Lottie and Marc E. are in danger of saying sayonara next week's Japanese challenge.
